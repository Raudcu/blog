To do this, I&#39;ll be using data from the Kaggle dog breed identification competition. It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds. . For the model, I&#39;m going to use a pretrained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub (I&#39;ll be using TensorFlow to train a model leveraging Transfert Learning). . For the first part (getting data ready and training the model) I&#39;m going to elaborate further (a lot) on a hands-on project from the zerotomastery Machine Learning Course. . For building the bot I&#39;ll follow this great post. . Data .",
